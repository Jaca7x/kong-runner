# Basic Dino game

Creating a clone of the Google Chrome dinosaur game is a great project for beginners learning C and game development. With the Raylib library, which focuses on simplicity and speed, you can build a fun and functional endless runner game using basic programming concepts.
In this project, the player controls a dinosaur that runs automatically across a desert landscape. The goal is to jump over obstacles (like cacti) and survive as long as possible. Each time an obstacle is avoided, the score increases and the game speed can gradually rise, making it more challenging over time.
Raylib makes it easy to handle graphics, keyboard input, and collision detection. You can draw the dinosaur and obstacles using simple shapes like rectangles or sprites, and use CheckCollisionRecs() to detect collisions. Jumping can be implemented with basic physics, using a vertical velocity variable and gravity acceleration.
This project helps beginners understand:
Endless runner game loops and logic

Keyboard input handling (e.g., jumping with SPACE key)

Simple physics simulation (gravity and jumping)

Collision detection using Raylib

Obstacle spawning and increasing difficulty

Score tracking and display on screen
